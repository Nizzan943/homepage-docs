2. Click user settings. (top corner next to your name badge.)
3. Click Personal-access-token.
4. Create new token with `Build` - `Read` permissions.
5. Put PAT in widget.key settings.

Allowed fields: `["totalPrs", "myPrs", "approvedNotCompleted"]`.

```yaml
widget:
    type: azurePipelines
    organization: my-organization
    project: my-project
    userEmail: my-organization-email
    repositoryId: my-repository-id (name)
    key: personal-access-token
